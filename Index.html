I am inexperienced in life and trying to figure out what kind of person I want to be. I am totally lost in this world so any life advice or wisdom would most definitely be appreciated! </p>

                <p>I absolutely love coffee so if any of you know any coffee shops and want to spend time with me coding or to talk in general, please let me know. Those who are also coffee addicts would know coffee is one of the few things that makes you willingly step out of your bed, every morning.</p>

                <h2 class="center">Gyming</h2>
                <p>I am a gym and coffee addict. I love working out due to my insecurities and getting borderline bullied while I was at school. To me, the gym sets the rules to life. Whatever you spend time on, you will improve on it. For example, if you do bicep curls, your biceps will improve, just like any other aspect of your life. </p>

                <h2 class="center">Coding</h2>
                <p>Honestly, I quite like coding. I spend a lot of time outside of class coding. For example this website, obviously it is still a work in progress but all the struggle I encounter is worth it. I really do hope one day I can work within the tech community and work with you all :) </p>

        <h2 id="bootcamp">What did I do <br> before bootcamp</h2>
        <p class="lasttext">I was a student studying civil engineering in HKUST and I absolutely despised it due to my lack of interest in it. I was doing it to please my parents which I found was not sustainable. I imagined myself working in the civil field 10 years from now and could not fathom any joy that would give me, which is why I took the responsibility of finding my passion into my own hands, took a leap of faith and joined this bootcamp. </p>
        <div class="icon1"></div>
        <h2 id="left">Why did I <br> join the bootcamp?</h2>
        <p class="lasttext" id="left"> I joined this bootcamp not because of the lack of resources online but more so to push and max out myself. The work network of this bootcamp is definitely something I look forward to taking advantage of as if I were to go through the self studying route I would have no access to that. </p>
